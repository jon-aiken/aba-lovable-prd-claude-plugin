# Lovable PRD Builder — Asset Directory

This directory can hold template files, example outputs, or other assets
used by the skill. Currently empty — assets are generated dynamically
based on the user's project specifics.

Potential future assets:
- Example completed PRD sets for reference
- Tailwind config snippets
- Supabase schema migration templates
