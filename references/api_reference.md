# Lovable PRD Builder — Reference Index

Quick guide to which reference file to read for each document:

| Document | Reference File | Lines |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Lovable.dev Platform Constraints | `lovable-platform.md` | Read first — shapes all decisions |
| Document 1: Masterplan | `masterplan-template.md` | Strategic foundation |
| Document 2: Implementation Plan | `implementation-plan-template.md` | Build sequence |
| Document 3: Design Guidelines | `design-guidelines-template.md` | Visual contract |
| Document 4: App Flow, Pages & Roles | `app-flow-template.md` | Structural blueprint |

## Reading Order

1. Always read `lovable-platform.md` first to understand constraints
2. Read each template file when generating the corresponding document
3. Generate documents in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4) since later documents reference earlier ones
